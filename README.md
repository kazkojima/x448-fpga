# An FPGA implementation of some x448 operations

This is my trial of a verilog implementation of some operations on curve448. See references below for each algorithm/implementation.

* add/sub/multiplication on GF(2^448-2^224-1). [4]
* Montgomery modular inverse. [2]
* Point addition on the twisted Edwards curve - curve448. [3]
* Scalar multiplication on the standard base point.

The target FPGA is ECP5-85G and yosys/nextpnr-ecp5 open software developing system is assumed. All operations except scalar multiplication with a given base point are tested successfully on the real chip with 36Mhz clock.

The routing of the scalar multiplication circuit takes ~40 hours on my PC :-(

scalarmult.v is a simple implementation of the scalar multiplication with a given base point, though its routing doesn't end successfully yet.


## Not secure

There are almost no countermeasures implemented against well-known attacks. See the references for them.

## Performance

Testbench shows ~4740 cycles are needed to complete a point addition and ~189680 cycles for a scalar multiplication on the standard base point of which x-cordinate is -\sqrt{5}/3 (0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa955555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555).

## x448.jl

jl/x448.jl is a collection of Julia functions written to help I understand each algorithm and verify the results of its execution on the FPGA counterpart. gen_precomp_448() generates precomputed data files [xyt]_precomp_448.dat which is a tabel of kB where B is the standard base point

where k = i*16^j for i in 0:15, j in 0:111. For example, the 3+5*16-th line of x_precomp_448.dat is (3*16^5)B.
